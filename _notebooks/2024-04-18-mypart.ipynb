    "# intro to arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are used to store one type of data, whether it is a primitive or reference data type. Arrays themselves are reference types. They are best thought of as a list of items with a fixed size, as arrays have a set size that cannot be changed (don't confuse this with ArrayLists which can also be thought of as a list - we'll learn about ArrayLists in\n",
    "Unit 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are denoted by brackets {0}, with items separated by commas such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can use arrays, we need to have an import statement, which is\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "import java.util.Arrays;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Making Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to make arrays: using a constructor and using a pre-initialized array.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructor\n",
    "As with other reference types, we can initialize arrays using a constructor. However, the constructor is slightly different from the constructors from Unit 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "dataType[] arrayName = new dataType[numberOfItems]; \n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "To create an array that holds 10 integers, we would do `int[] ourArray = new int[10];`\n",
    "The items in the array are initialized differently depending on the data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integers are initialized to 0\n",
    "\n",
    "- Doubles are initialized to 0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "- Booleans are initialized to false\n",
    "\n",
    "- All reference types are initialized to null\n",
    "\n",
    "We will talk about filling constructed lists in the next topic when we discuss traversing arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-initialized Arraycx\n",
    "We can also set an array to a pre-initialized array, similar to how we initialize strings. Here, we will initialize an array of 10 integers as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int[] ourArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "We access elements in arrays using bracket notation as follows: arrayName[index]. The most important thing to know is that Java is a zero-indexed language, so the first item has index 0, and not 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we talk about the index of the last item, we need to discuss how to find the array length. The array length is actually an instance variable specific to that particular array denoted as arrayName.length (not to be confused with length) for Strings). Note that this is not a method, so there are no parentheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the last item in the array can be accessed by using arrayName.length - 1. Do not confuse this with the constructor in which we use arrayName.length in brackets.\n",
    "]\\dffgh54r45\n",
    "If we use an index outside the allowed range, we will get an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.\n",
    "Here is a question: how do we access the even numbers in arrayOne from above?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "a\n",
    "### answer\n",
    "```java\n",
    "2 = arrayOne[1]\n",
    "4 = arrayOne[3]\n",
    "6 = arrayOne[5]\n",
    "8 = arrayOne[7]\n",
    "10 = arrayOne[9]\n",
    "``` 98i9i976y7w76\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Terms to Remember: \n",
    "- <mark>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</mark>: `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` is an exception that occurs when trying to access an invalid index position in an array. It is thrown to indicate that the index used to access an array is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.\n",
    "k,l\n",
    "- <mark>arrayName.length</mark>: The property `\"length\"` is used to determine the number of elements in an array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <mark>Arrays</mark>: `Arrays` are a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. They have a fixed size and can be accessed using an index.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <mark>fixed size</mark>: `Fixed size` refers to a data structure or container whose size cannot be changed once it is created. Once initialized with a specific capacity or length, no additional elements can be added or removed frovm it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <mark>import java.util.Arrays</mark>: This term refers to a statement in Java that allows you to access the functionality of the Arrays class from the `java.util` package. It is used to import specific classes or entire packages into your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <mark>Primitive data type </mark>: `Primitive data types` are basic data types provided by programming languages, such as integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and characters. They represent simple values and have predefined characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- <mark>Reference Data Type </mark>: A `reference data type` is a data type that refers to an object in memory rather than directly storing the value. It stores the memory address where the object is located.\n"
