In this case, the first boolean condition evaluates to false since a is not greater than c and the second boolean condition evaluates to false since b is not greater than a, and the value of c is returned, which is the greatest of all three integers. Consider the second example where a = 5, b = 6, and c = 5. In this case, the first boolean condition evaluates to false since a is not greater than b and the second boolean condition evaluates to true since b is greater than a and b is greater than c,  and the value of b is returned which is the greatest of the three values. Consider the third example where a = 5, b = 5, and c = 5. In this case, the first boolean condition evaluates to false since a is not greater than b and the second boolean condition evaluates to false since b is  not greater than a,  and the else is executed so the value of c is returned. Since all three values were equal any of the values could be returned as the greatest of the three values.\n",

The first iteration of the inner loop would assign 1 to n, and the element at row[1], which is 2, would be printed. The second iteration of the inner loop would assign 2 to n, and the element at row[2], which is 3, would be printed. The third iteration of the inner loop would assign 3 to n, and attempt to access row[3] causing an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExeception to be thrown, since the length of row is 3 with indices 0, 1, 2.
