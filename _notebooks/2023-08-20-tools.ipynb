    "ThIs Is the reason why I love my tools. If I did not have my tools, it would make my life a lot harder. If I did not have my tools, then that means I would not have vscode. If I did not have my tools, that that means that I couldn't work on my latest passion project. If I did not have my tools, then that means I couldn't watch youtube. If I did not have my tools, then that means that I couldn't commit my work to github and keep It safe. If I did not have my tools, you wouldn't be able to read this amazing paragraph. If I dId not have my tools, then that means that I could not write thIs. If I did not have my tools, then that will mean that I couldn't be caught up to the latest announcements. If I did not have my tools, never mInd, I can live wIthout wsl. If I did not have my tools, then I could not check my work in real time Instead of committing the same error over and over again. If I did not have my tools, I would be pulling out my hair. \n"
