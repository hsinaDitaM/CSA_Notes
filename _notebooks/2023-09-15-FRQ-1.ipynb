    "## Grading:\n",
    "I took very similar steps to the the frq question answer. the key difference is that collegeboard wrote their code with their less verbose code and i wrote mine in java with is a more complex language. I also used the variable names that collegeboard wanted me to use. if was a collegeboard grader, what a boring job, I would give 4/4 because I followed similarly to what collegeboard wanted. \n",

    "## Reflection:\n",
    "the first time that i represented the frq to the crossover team, my code didn't run and i had to resort to python, but now i can assure you that this java codes as well as a well fed horse. To be honest, chatgpt helped me to write at least half of this code, but i understand the logic and the process and how the code should be. the things i need to improve my knowledge on is java because if i don't learn it properly now, it will be difficult for me in future when i have to write bigger and code heavy projects. overall, i am happy that i was able to solve this frq in java and present it clearly to my crossover team. \n",
